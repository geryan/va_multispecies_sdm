remake relative abundance maps

pred abundances for 3 spp per paper

get proportional abundance

plot 3-panel proportions
or RGB - each sp one col - do both


for posterior pred checks
calculate using draws, not some nsim, which will calculate posterior of draws
# leave p
 p <- icloglog(log_lambda[model_notna_idx_pa] + log(area_pa))
# distribution(data_infilled[model_notna_idx_pa]) <- bernoulli(p)

data_infilled_sim <- bernoulli(p)
calculate(data_infilled_sim, draws) #@ this simulates the data which is then compared with
the existing data via DHARMA etc per IR code.




- confirm taxonomic groupings with WRBU database / MS/AW - then fix clean_species.R

- check target species again - compare data record numbers

-- survey method into data records
-- have multiple observations for pa/po data? get rid of summarise in make_model_data_ragged l29 (also keep non-uniques)
-- assumption of presence-absence data type
- and therefore inference of zeroes in non-na is based on any zero count or binary absence in a given source - check with MS/AW - also applies to wht is count vs what is PA

hierarchy: is it count? failing that is it PA? failing that is it PO. At first two levels can we imply implicit zeroes for other species

- need to differentiate the process for classifying PA/count and process for implying zeroes - i.e. DNA sampling

-- effort level based on survey method (and trap nights? hopefully?)
-- HLC indoor vs outdoor, CDC, animal baited trap, drop weird methods
- need RE for method from zero mean RE. Use RE value for outdoor HLC as predictor.

-- later consider neg bin / overdispersion for count data

-- MAP cubes from 2000 - / use time-varying microclimate suitability to predict with offset to make cube

-- reduce covars
-- get rid of climate covs to
-- ditch EVI, LST, pressure, solrad,
-- ditch easting / northing


-- (re)consider expert map overlays for all spp, esp ones for which no previous map available (currently none) "use to account for dispersal limitation"

-- need to define base species and complexes before obs models

-- consider alternate bg point sampling eg stratification

- add offsets for exert_opinion and microclim:
log(offset) = log(expert_opinion_offset) + log(microclim_offset)
 --- then only sample bg points within the buffer area of the expert opinion maps
 ---
-- merow justification for offset approach: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.12453


-- update an gamb microclimate layer - rerun microclim

### data processing assumptions / checks
- confirmation of diagnostic level with ability to infer zero (e.g. pcr)



## model
po_records ~ Poisson(intensity * bias)
pa ~ Bernoulli(prob_pres)
count ~  Poisson(lambda * effort)
intensity = lambda * intercept
prob_pres = icloglog(lambda * effort)
